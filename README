Entry File Drop plugin for Movable Type

This plugin enables you to drag-n-drop files to the assets box on the edit entry screen.
they will be uploaded as if you have 'add asset' them one-by-one

It gives you a small "Manage Tags" dialog (link in the buttom of the assets box)

You can set (in the blog plugin config page) a list of suggested tags, and they 
will be added as special buttons to the list
