Entry File Drop plugin for Movable Type
---------------------------------------

This plugin enables you to drag-n-drop files to the assets box on the edit entry screen.
they will be uploaded as if you have 'add asset' them one-by-one.

It gives you a small "Manage Tags" dialog (link in the buttom of the assets box)
that let you add and remove tags for the entry tags.

You can set (in the blog plugin config page) a list of suggested tags, and they 
will be added as special buttons to the list.

You can sort the assets by any field. So it the entry assets are sorted by some
field in the template, you can see them sorted in your asset box.

You can add colors to assets, using coditions. Conditions can be a tag on the asset,
or comparing the field (that is used for sorting) to some value.
The plugin comes with a CSS file with basic colors, using "asset-bg-<color>",
where color can be blue, red, green, yellow, brown, gray.
